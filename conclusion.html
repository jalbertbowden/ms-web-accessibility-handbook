            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Throughout this guide weve learned about practical strategies for making web content accessible and that there are several pieces that need to fit together to create an organizational approach to accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Weve learned how important it is for an organization to set accessibility standards and seen a real-world example, the Accessibility Kit for SharePoint, that helps integrate accessibility testing into the development processmaking it easier to meet organizational standards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Weve seen how accessibility can increase sales and decrease maintenance costs, building a good business case for integrating accessibility into an organizations web development processes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A key strategy for helping developers implement accessibility is to make it easy for them to make the right decisions and we learned about several examples of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Accessible by Default</i>, where accessibility strategies are built into development products.</p>
            <p>The European Dialogues on Web Accessibility have been a rewarding experience and created the basis for an evolving body of knowledge that can help us reach our shared goal of an accessible Web.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Microsoft and HiSoftware will continue to partner with others to improve the Riga Dashboard and increase web accessibility.</p>

            <p>There is now the opportunity and the imperative to make real progress toward a more inclusive society through an accessible Web.</p>
            <p>This handbook from Microsoft and HiSoftware is one result of a series of interactive dialogues on the current state of Web accessibility between government officials, industry leaders, and NGO representatives across several European countries. It combines practical strategies with some of the perspectives, goals, and vision that came out of those dialogues. Our intent is to provide a tool that will help organizations worldwide foster accessibility in their operations.</p>
            <p>This handbook begins with a summary of the important knowledge shared at the series of European dialogues on Web accessibility. Those lessons-learned and best practices are followed by an example process for implementing a comprehensive Web accessibility program in any organization. Building on that framework, there is an example of a product and community that helps organizations <span class=GramE>implement</span> some of the practical strategies from the dialogues. Finally, there is a discussion of specific tools and tips to understand and meet Web accessibility standards.</p>
