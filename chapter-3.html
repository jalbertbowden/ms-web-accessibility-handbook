<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>One
of the practical strategies consistently identified and discussed at the
European Dialogues on Web Accessibility is the importance and usefulness of
defining a process for creating and maintaining accessible Web sites.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This chapter will describe what an effective
process based approach might look like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Approaching
Web content quality management as an afterthought can be a circular and costly
strategy. Organizations that include accessible design and quality management
as part of their development plans, quality assurance and testing practices
will have a tremendous economic advantage. For example, according to a study by
Forrester Research, the cost of retrofitting a Web site for accessibility can
be as much as ten times the cost of designing an accessible site from the
ground up.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Web
sites that contain accessibility issues, such as broken links, improperly

online transactions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Testing,
remediation and monitoring solutions that easily integrate into current
practices enable organizations to build standards based compliancy testing into
their existing planning, development, quality assurance, and defect tracking
processes. These solutions can empower content managers and executives to
implement, remediate, and monitor </span>compliance to regulatory and corporate
Web standards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>An integrated approach
will also help organizations troubleshoot sources of quality issues and
identify inaccessible Web content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three important components of a process based approach to
accessibility include the following elements: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with any project, putting the right leadership team in
place is essential.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>An accessibility
project team should include individuals from every group that contributes to
the development and maintenance of a Web site. In the average organization the
following groups would most likely be represented:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Participation and support from key members of the
organization can assist in providing the funding and effort to incorporate
accessibility testing into the Web project life cycle. It is extremely
important that an organization develop both a top down strategy, with
commitment and executive sponsorship of the accessibility plan, as well as
bottom up support from the Web architects and Web developers. Through this
combined approach, accessibility can be seamlessly integrated into existing
company practices for Web planning, development, testing and deployment.</p>

<h2>Three Types of Testing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Web sites become more complex and interactive,
development of Web sites becomes more and more like software development.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If we look to the processes of software testing,
we will see that there other types of testing besides what is typically done
for Web sites.</p>

     tab-stops:list .5in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Compliance
     testing</b> Does the Web site conform to guidelines and standards?<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This can be automated to a certain
     extent, particularly for sites that contain mostly documents and few
     interactive application features.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
     </span>Some aspects of compliance will require functional testing, and
     others will require human inspection of test results generated by
     automated tools.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oftentimes, the three types of testing are combined or
confused, or they are completed out of order.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Completing them in the given order is important for achieving accurate
results.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For example, while usability
testing is valuable early in the process, it can be blocked by functional
bugs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So, it is best to engage in
usability testing after you have identified and fixed functional issues.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Automated compliance testing can also be
blocked by functional problems, preventing the tools from reaching all parts of
the site.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Involving users throughout the design and development
process provides valuable feedback and there are a variety of methods to gather
feedback from potential users: focus groups, usability testing on previous
versions of the product, and testing with paper prototypes among others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;mso-pagination:none;mso-hyphenate:none'>Automated testing solutions can
be used to great effect in compliance testing a site or groups of documents. It
is very important to remember that<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> no</i></b> tool alone can validate the
absolute accessibility of a Web site. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>However
a good software solution can identify a majority of what needs to be manually
inspected. Additionally, a good solution will identify which pages do not need
to be manually inspected, based on the absence of elements that require manual
inspection.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Remember:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A human will still need to assure that all
manual checkpoints identified by the solution are accessible, and some aspects
of compliance require functional testing.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;mso-pagination:none;mso-hyphenate:none'>Therefore, all three types of
testing are important and each has its place in the software development
process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This becomes more important as
Web sites become Web applications and software testing methodologies are
employed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Testing is no longer just
about crawling the code looking for specific attributes, elements, and tree
structures, it becomes a matter of ensuring that the application works as
designed and that the interface is perceivable, operable, and understandable by
end users.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<h2><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Planning and Implementation</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following are the four basic phases of developing and
maintaining an accessible Web site:</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Develop a
plan</b> Set organization goals, design guidelines and standards, and perform an
assessment of your Web site or application. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Understand that the requirements are different
for application features than they are for documents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Many organizations choose to build policies
around the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.0, which are intended to cover the ever-expanding set of Web technologies and
to focus on techniques for implementation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l20 level1 lfo24'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'><span

<h2><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Empowerment</h2>

<h3>Provide tools to Web site designers and content creators to build
accessible content</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Giving team members the tools that they need to do the right
thing from the beginning is the most cost effective approach to accessibility.
Experience tells us that no one builds a Web site intending that it be
inaccessible, but education, simplicity, and real empowerment are key factors
to a successful strategy.</p>

<h3>Implementing Organizational Guidelines</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the accessibility goals and guidelines developed, and a
baseline audit completed, the next phase of the project begins. In this phase
developers and quality assurance teams receive training and begin the process
of retrofitting the company Web site. Organizations must first make an
assessment of what is being done right and what is not being developed so that
it is accessible.</p>

<h3>Automate testing and understand where automation is not enough</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>An accessibility testing strategy will provide an
organization with the ability to view accessibility from a project management
perspective. This will enable an organization to:</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>Keep a historical view of your Web site
accessibility work.</p>

<h3>Reward good behavior and set reasonable consequences if standards are not
followed</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most employees strive to be successful in their jobs. Once a
Web accessibility strategy has been implemented, recognize teams and team
members who work hard to accomplish their goals. Allow them to lead by example.
Often evangelists within an organization who embrace the concepts and
methodology behind accessible development can serve as mentors and trainers for
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This phased approach offers the best opportunity for Web
site compliance to accessibility guidelines and standards. Companies can avoid
becoming a target and look forward to the continued accessibility of their Web
content once they develop the above disciplines. There are many good reasons
for supporting the creation of accessible Web content. It is important to
recognize that these changes will not happen overnight. Once it is clear that
developing accessible is achievable, affordable, and can provide a
competitive edge, it will become common rather than the exception.</p>
