Introduction</h1>

Microsoft and HiSoftware believe there <span
class=GramE>is</span> now the opportunity and the imperative to make real
progress toward a more inclusive society through an accessible Web.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Riga Ministerial Declaration of June 11,
2006 emphasizes that only 3% of public Web sites surveyed comply with the
minimum Web accessibility standards and guidelines, hindering access to Web
content and services for people with disabilities who comprise some 15% of the
EU population.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The declaration sets an
ambitious policy goal: 100% of public Web sites to be accessible by 2010.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The tools and strategies to address this
problem exist which means it is possible to make significant and rapid
improvement with reasonable effort and expense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Web accessibility can be an area of sincere focus for organizations of
all types and sizes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>today</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Education and training represent some of the
biggest obstacles for public agencies and private sector enterprises to create
accessible Web sites  simply knowing what to do and how to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Recognizing
that the disappointing statistics show that we are not where we would like to
be with Web accessibility and knowing that the tools exist to make progress, we
asked ourselves, What can be done?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We decided
to conduct a series of Web accessibility dialogues.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Not simply a single day or an ad hoc event,
but a process that would lead us from Lisbon to Vienna to the next e&#8209;Inclusion
Conference and beyondto real, measurable progress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Throughout 2008, Microsoft gathered
government officials, industry leaders, and non-governmental organization (NGO)
representatives across several European countries as part of a series of
interactive dialogues on the current state of Web accessibility. The objective
of the Dialogues was to explore how critical players in both public
organizations and private industry can work together on solutions that create a
more accessible World Wide Web.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
Dialogues featured robust conversation that both framed the challenges faced by
proponents of Web accessibility and illuminated various solutions that organizations
are using to realize the shared goal of an accessible Web environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This Handbook from Microsoft and HiSoftware
is one result of the European Dialogues on Web Accessibility.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It combines practical strategies with some of
the perspectives, goals, and vision that came out of those Dialogues.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Our intent is to provide a tool that will
help organizations worldwide foster accessibility in their operations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The handbook begins with a summary of the
important knowledge shared at the series of European Dialogues on Web
Accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Those lessons-learned and
best practices are followed by an example process for implementing a
comprehensive Web accessibility program in any organization.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Building on that framework, there is an
example of a product and community that helps organizations <span class=GramE>implement</span>
some of the practical strategies from the Dialogues. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Finally, the Handbook offers some specific
tools and tips to understand and meet Web accessibility standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
