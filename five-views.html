<blockquote>
  <p>Accessibility should not be an afterthought for web services. Organizations need to develop and communicate their accessibility strategy with senior stakeholders then provide tools enabling developers to automatically deliver fully accessible services. Only this approach coupled with robust testing - both with real users and from a technical perspective - and a rigorous governance process ensure that an organization not only complies with the legislation but also meets the needs of all its customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web Accessibility dialogues and this handbook provide an opportunity for organizations like Lloyds TSB to share best practices and real life solutions so that effective strategies can be understood and adopted more broadly. Evidence suggests a piecemeal approach to accessibility is unlikely to create repeatable, scalable and sustainable processes that ensure adherence to accessibility standards and best practice. Organizations should instead look beyond off the shelf guidelines by adopting a formal and holistic approach which will result in accessibility becoming an ingrained part of their IT processes and practices, not an afterthought, nice to have or an optional extra.</p>

  <p>This handbook is a valuable resource with a strong practical focus to accessibility. It highlights the importance of disabled user testing to complement the automated and manual auditing process - so vital when websites are becoming web applications and user interaction ever more complex.</p>
  <cite>Robin Christopherson, Head of Accessibility Services, AbilityNet</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations of all sizes and types can take positive steps towards more inclusive and accessible websites. Resources like this handbook, documenting proven strategies and existing solutions, are a great resource as we all strengthen our commitment to web accessibility.</p>
