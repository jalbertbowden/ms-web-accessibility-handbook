<h1>Chapter 2<br>
Summary of European Dialogues on Web Accessibility - Practical Strategies for
an Accessible Web</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Microsoft and HiSoftware, the purpose of the European
Dialogues on Web Accessibility was very specifically to create a body of
knowledge that can be reused to improve the state of Web accessibility across
Europe and worldwide.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Our approach was
to bring together people with in-depth Web accessibility expertise but with
different perspectives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We intentionally
included representatives from both the public and private sectors and from non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We designed the
Dialogues to be very interactive in order to uncover and share the greatest
amount of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This summary is an attempt to reflect many of the insights,
questions, and solutions that were uncovered and explored during the
Dialogues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Like the Dialogues, the
summary focuses on three important topics: the business imperative for broader Web
accessibility, challenges for Web accessibility, and strategies for an
accessible Web.</p>

<h2>Business Imperatives for Web Accessibility</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is real economic opportunity with accessible Web sites.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of the most important outcomes of the
Dialogues was the identification of several compelling reasons for why an
accessible Web makes good business sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Some of those reasons include:</p>

<h3>Market Benefits</h3>

</span></span></span><![endif]>The number one reason for making a Web site
accessible is to allow people to access your services and your site effectively
and easily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It is not just to meet a
series of checkpoints. </p>

estimated overall economic opportunity associated with Web accessibility, as
determined by the Directorate-General for Information Society and Media, is 85
billion over the next five years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>Across the European Union (EU), improving
accessibility for the elderly population means improving access to holders of
more than <span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>3 trillion, or
approximately one-third of the European economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>Half of those elderly Europeans are not only
willing to spend their money on a better quality of life, but are called
hedonistic: they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>want</i> to spend their
money on a better quality of life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Often
they cannot find products and services that meet their needs and abilities.<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Accessible content opens doors to more
consumers. In many cases, Web content built with accessibility in mind is more popular
with audiences than content that does not consider accessibility.<span

</span></span></span><![endif]>Accessible content helps recruit loyal customers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When customers can work with an
organizations online presence, they can better complete purchases and improve
conversion rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Customers will return
to those sites that provide them with a positive experience.</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>In many European markets there has been an
almost explosive growth in internet shopping.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>It is important that consumers can find the button that lets them buy
something.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As many consumers as possible
need to get there in order to increase sales.</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>This is not a minority issue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Microsoft Research shows that more than 60%
of internet users would benefit from using an accessible Web page, even if they
do not have any disabilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Accessibility
is a majority issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Everyone gains; it
is a win-win proposition.<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>Many people are affected by Web
accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In addition to people
with disabilities, people who are elderly, people who are accessing the Web
from mobile phones and people who are accessing it in a second language all
benefit from accessible content.<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>There are many excellent examples where Web
accessibility has been a challenge, been addressed, and led to a direct
business benefit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One example is a
large, international grocery store chain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>They had created a Web site for online shopping that looked fantastic
but inaccessible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They used additional
resources to create a second, accessible site.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>It generated significant revenue in the first year, because everyone
liked using it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The company has now
moved to a single site solution  the accessible one.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Another example is a large financial services
company based in the UK.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It had an issue
with its portal and was not seeing sales conversions on products, such as life
insurance policies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There were
complaints about the accessibility and usability of the site.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It did a complete revamp of the site and
found that, overnight, there was a 90% increase in sales of life insurance
policies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The increase was due to
improvement of the entire user experience but accessibility was a fundamental
component.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span lang=EN-GB

<h3>Business and Technical Benefits</h3>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Accessibility is the gift that keeps giving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Benefits from Web accessibility go well
beyond legal compliance and risk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For an
organization there can be usability and productivity benefits, cost reductions,
technical infrastructure improvements, wider markets, increased staff retention
and better talent management.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>For many organizations, including governmental
bodies, financial services companies, and so on, conducting business online is
considerably cheaper than conducting business offline.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Adopting an accessibility strategy early on
enables an organization to implement it on its own schedule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Retrofitting sites after they launch is
considerably more expensive that developing accessible content from scratch.
Many organizations are already faced with legislation that requires that they
provide accessible content, and the threat of expanding legislation is very
real for a number of industries. Companies that engage an accessibility
strategy soon can get ahead of legislation, as well as develop and implement
content on their own terms and budget before it is mandated and before losing
customers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Adopting an accessibility strategy puts an
organization in a leadership position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Fostering
accessibility is the right thing to do, and its not prohibitively expensive.
Taking an early stand allows an organization to position itself as a leader in
its sector and present excellent opportunities for positive press and free
marketing. </p>

Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>If Web pages are more accessible, they will
receive more hits and will move higher up in search engine results. Search
engines make ranking decisions based on the same information that assistive
technologies use to create an accessible user experience, including document
structure and alternative text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>The technical benefits of an accessible Web site
are numerous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>An accessible Web site is
easier to translate into a different language, easier to internationalize, and
easier to render on a mobile phone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Maintenance costs can be reduced and better search engine optimization can
be achieveddriving more people to the site.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>This is in addition to increasing conversion rates and getting a better
return on the investment by reducing running costs.</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>Organizations want to attract the best
talent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In the UK, 6% of honors
graduates&nbsp;are students with disabilities but 85% of online recruitment
systems are inaccessible to them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>Employees with disabilities are often the most
loyal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Whereas the average employee
might change jobs every two to three&nbsp;years, employees with disabilities
tend to stay in jobs considerably.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>Much of the power of corporate intranets is
contingent on every single employee being able to perform tasks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Using the intranet as a communication tool
broadly improves engagement and responsiveness within an organization.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>It makes no sense to move employees to an
intranet and then produce a version in Braille.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>With accessible intranets, printing costs are reduced.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>Many organizations report that staff members with
disabilities are highly motivated contributors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>If an organization can use Web and intranet accessibility to attract and
retain them, it would be a clear benefit.</p>

<h2>Web Accessibility Challenges</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Participants in the Dialogues identified and explained a
complex set of challenges that organizations face when trying to promote Web accessibility.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Those challenges include:</p>

<h3>Benchmarking</h3>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>There is agreement that Web accessibility
measurement and benchmarking are important for different reasons: for goal
setting, for measuring progress, and for proving a business case for Web
accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, there seem to be
numerous metrics for Web accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>What is the preferred measurement?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Is it sensible to first agree on what Web accessibility is and then to define
a common measurement or just measure it according to what you are currently
doing without asking how you arrive at a given number?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>After a measurement or benchmarking tool is
selected, the challenge is to understand what the analysis means.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo11'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:

</span></span></span><![endif]>How much compliance is enough?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If you have one issue on a Web page, you fail
an automated test. What is the threshold?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Do you need 100% compliance on one set of pages or tasks and 80% on
another?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Do you need 90% across the
board?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Where is that threshold and how do
you prioritize against it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

Symbol'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Because of the dynamic nature of Web sites, they
can be accessible one day and two weeks later, after the content has changed, they
are not as accessible as they were. It is important to be able to monitor a Web
site and its content to ensure that accessibility is maintained. Organizations
need to start accessible and remain accessible. It is pointless to have an
accessible Web site on day one only. </p>

of Web accessibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Often there is
little progress and sometimes there is even a decline.<span

</span></span></span><![endif]>Legislation helps promote Web accessibility but
it is not sufficient.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There are limits
to the effectiveness of public policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Often there is no budget or financial resources to accompany Web

</span></span></span><![endif]>The Web represents millions of sites, many of which
are created by end users and content creators who are not trained software developers.
Expecting programmatic accessibility fixes to be made by these end users seems
unrealistic. </p>

that allows you to build accessible Web site templates and an accessible

not have an accessible Web site.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The platform

the right thing, it can be so complex that they make mistakes. The result can
