            <h1>Chapter 2 <span class="block">Summary of European Dialogues on Web Accessibility - Practical Strategies for an Accessible Web</span></h1>
            <p>For Microsoft and HiSoftware, the purpose of the European Dialogues on Web Accessibility was very specifically to create a body of knowledge that can be reused to improve the state of Web accessibility across Europe and worldwide. Our approach was to bring together people with in-depth Web accessibility expertise but with different perspectives.We intentionally included representatives from both the public and private sectors and from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).We designed the Dialogues to be very interactive in order to uncover and share the greatest amount of knowledge and experience.</p>
            <p>This summary is an attempt to reflect many of the insights, questions, and solutions that were uncovered and explored during the Dialogues.Like the Dialogues, the summary focuses on three important topics: the business imperative for broader Web accessibility, challenges for Web accessibility, and strategies for an accessible Web.</p>
            <h2>Business Imperatives for Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>There is real economic opportunity with accessible Web sites. One of the most important outcomes of the Dialogues was the identification of several compelling reasons for why an accessible Web makes good business sense. Some of those reasons include:</p>
            <h3>Market Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>The number one reason for making a Web site accessible is to allow people to access your services and your site effectively and easily.It is not just to meet a series of checkpoints. </li>
  <li>The estimated overall economic opportunity associated with Web accessibility, as determined by the Directorate-General for Information Society and Media, is 85 billion over the next five years.</li>
  <li>Across the European Union (EU), improving accessibility for the elderly population means improving access to holders of more than 3 trillion, or approximately one-third of the European economy.</li>
  <li>Half of those elderly Europeans are not only willing to spend their money on a better quality of life, but are called hedonistic: they <i>want</i> to spend their money on a better quality of life.Often they cannot find products and services that meet their needs and abilities.</li>
  <li>Accessible content opens doors to more consumers. In many cases, Web content built with accessibility in mind is more popular with audiences than content that does not consider accessibility.</li>
  <li>Accessible content helps recruit loyal customers. When customers can work with an organizations online presence, they can better complete purchases and improve conversion rates.Customers will return to those sites that provide them with a positive experience.</li>
  <li>In many European markets there has been an almost explosive growth in internet shopping. It is important that consumers can find the button that lets them buy something.As many consumers as possible need to get there in order to increase sales.</li>
  <li>This is not a minority issue. Microsoft Research shows that more than 60% of internet users would benefit from using an accessible Web page, even if they do not have any disabilities. Accessibility is a majority issue. Everyone gains; it is a win-win proposition.</li>
  <li>Many people are affected by Web accessibility.In addition to people with disabilities, people who are elderly, people who are accessing the Web from mobile phones and people who are accessing it in a second language all benefit from accessible content.</li>
  <li>There are many excellent examples where Web accessibility has been a challenge, been addressed, and led to a direct business benefit.One example is a large, international grocery store chain. They had created a Web site for online shopping that looked fantastic but inaccessible.They used additional resources to create a second, accessible site. It generated significant revenue in the first year, because everyone liked using it.The company has now moved to a single site solution  the accessible one.</li>
  <li>Another example is a large financial services company based in the UK. It had an issue with its portal and was not seeing sales conversions on products, such as life insurance policies.There were complaints about the accessibility and usability of the site. It did a complete revamp of the site and found that, overnight, there was a 90% increase in sales of life insurance policies.The increase was due to improvement of the entire user experience but accessibility was a fundamental component.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Business and Technical Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>Accessibility is the gift that keeps giving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Benefits from Web accessibility go well beyond legal compliance and risk.For an organization there can be usability and productivity benefits, cost reductions, technical infrastructure improvements, wider markets, increased staff retention
and better talent management.</li>
  <li>For many organizations, including governmental
bodies, financial services companies, and so on, conducting business online is
considerably cheaper than conducting business offline.</li>
  <li>Adopting an accessibility strategy early on
enables an organization to implement it on its own schedule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Retrofitting sites after they launch is
considerably more expensive that developing accessible content from scratch.
Many organizations are already faced with legislation that requires that they
provide accessible content, and the threat of expanding legislation is very
real for a number of industries. Companies that engage an accessibility
strategy soon can get ahead of legislation, as well as develop and implement
content on their own terms and budget before it is mandated and before losing
customers.</li>
  <li>Adopting an accessibility strategy puts an
organization in a leadership position.Fostering
accessibility is the right thing to do, and its not prohibitively expensive.
Taking an early stand allows an organization to position itself as a leader in
its sector and present excellent opportunities for positive press and free
marketing.</li>
  <li>If Web pages are more accessible, they will
receive more hits and will move higher up in search engine results. Search
engines make ranking decisions based on the same information that assistive
technologies use to create an accessible user experience, including document
structure and alternative text.</li>
  <li>The technical benefits of an accessible Web site
are numerous.An accessible Web site is
easier to translate into a different language, easier to internationalize, and
easier to render on a mobile phone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Maintenance costs can be reduced and better search engine optimization can
be achieveddriving more people to the site.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>This is in addition to increasing conversion rates and getting a better
return on the investment by reducing running costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Workplace Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>Organizations want to attract the best talent.In the UK, 6% of honors graduates&nbsp;are students with disabilities but 85% of online recruitment systems are inaccessible to them.</li>
  <li>In the UK, 78% of people with disabilities became disabled during their working lives. Accessible Web sites can help them keep their jobs.</li>
  <li>Employees with disabilities are often the most loyal.Whereas the average employee might change jobs every two to three&nbsp;years, employees with disabilities tend to stay in jobs considerably.</li>
  <li>Much of the power of corporate intranets is contingent on every single employee being able to perform tasks. Using the intranet as a communication tool broadly improves engagement and responsiveness within an organization.</li>
  <li>It makes no sense to move employees to an intranet and then produce a version in Braille. With accessible intranets, printing costs are reduced.</li>
  <li>Many organizations report that staff members with disabilities are highly motivated contributors. If an organization can use Web and intranet accessibility to attract and retain them, it would be a clear benefit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Web Accessibility Challenges</h2>
            <p>Participants in the Dialogues identified and explained a complex set of challenges that organizations face when trying to promote Web accessibility. Those challenges include:</p>
            <h3>Benchmarking</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>There is agreement that Web accessibility measurement and benchmarking are important for different reasons: for goal setting, for measuring progress, and for proving a business case for Web accessibility. However, there seem to be numerous metrics for Web accessibility. What is the preferred measurement? Is it sensible to first agree on what Web accessibility is and then to define a common measurement or just measure it according to what you are currently doing without asking how you arrive at a given number?</li>
  <li>After a measurement or benchmarking tool is selected, the challenge is to understand what the analysis means.</li>
  <li>How much compliance is enough? If you have one issue on a Web page, you fail an automated test. What is the threshold? Do you need 100% compliance on one set of pages or tasks and 80% on another?Do you need 90% across the board? Where is that threshold and how do you prioritize against it?</li>
  <li>Because of the dynamic nature of Web sites, they can be accessible one day and two weeks later, after the content has changed, they are not as accessible as they were. It is important to be able to monitor a Web site and its content to ensure that accessibility is maintained. Organizations need to start accessible and remain accessible. It is pointless to have an accessible Web site on day one only.</li>
  <li>In some countries there are regular evaluations of Web accessibility.Often there is little progress and sometimes there is even a decline.</li>
  <li>There is no benchmarking system across European member states to make comparisons across countries and/or to enable sharing of best practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Policy Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>Legislation helps promote Web accessibility but it is not sufficient.There are limits to the effectiveness of public policy. Often there is no budget or financial resources to accompany Web accessibility requirements.</li>
  <li>Most countries in Europe have legislation and government guidelines on Web accessibility. While those countries with legislation are doing slightly better, across Europe the rate of Web accessibility is still not that good.</li>
  <li>Multiple policy approaches implemented across Europe to legislate e-Inclusion have led to a mixed array of regulations and, in some cases, further complicate attempts to address the issue.</li>
  <li>Countries with guidelines are pushing the accessibility agenda forward but without support from government, it will not be effective.</li>
  <li>Even with a very strong legal framework there are no ways to control how that legislation is being applied.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Content Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>The Web represents millions of sites, many of which are created by end users and content creators who are not trained software developers. Expecting programmatic accessibility fixes to be made by these end users seems unrealistic.</li>
  <li>Even if you have a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to build accessible Web site templates and an accessible framework, if your content creators know nothing about accessibility then you will not have an accessible Web site.The platform and the content creators have to work together.</li>
  <li>Even in places where content creators want to do the right thing, it can be so complex that they make mistakes. The result can be implementations that somewhat meet a checklist but they are completely different from each other. All have different accessibility issues and different usability levels.</li>
  <li>An organization can have a governance process that requires a project team to comply with standards, but user-generated content presents additional challenges. Many organizations encourage knowledge sharing through blogs and wikis. While this empowers individual business users, how do you require them to generate accessible content? It is impossible to police it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Awareness Challenges </h3>
            <ul>
  <li>A major challenge in many organizations, especially initially, is to raise the profile of Web accessibility. The challenge is multi-pronged and includes lack of awareness, lack of understanding and lack of investment of key stakeholders who can effect positive change.</li>
  <li>In general, there is a lack of common understanding about accessibility. Without a common understanding how do we measure accessibility across Europe?How do we find the best cases and practices?How do we find a common understanding about strategy?</li>
  <li>At an organizational level, not everyone is aware of Web accessibility and related problems. There is no culture of accessibility among public managers or technology officers. They do not have a technical understanding of Web accessibility.</li>
  <li>There are a growing number of Web developers who have been trained in usability and accessibility and have a good understanding of how to implement and test for accessibility. However, most people either do not know about accessibility or have misconceptions about how or why to implement it.</li>
  <li>There may be a lack of self-identification within some organizations. For example, when told that their intranet is not accessible, some Intranet managers say but we do not employ any disabled people. This is a cyclical issue: If an organization does not have an accessible intranet, people with disabilities cannot enter the front door. An organization is usually not aware that this has serious repercussions with regard to employment and equality.</li>
  <li>Organizations looking to implement an accessibility strategy need to be aware of and account for the diverse needs people with disabilities bring to the Web, including the fact that some people have multiple disabilities and require a variety of strategies all at once. People with visual disabilities have a very different set of needs than those with a dexterity disability, <span class=GramE>who</span> have different needs than someone with dyslexia, and so on. Also, as the online population ages, more individuals will bring combinations of these issues with them to the Web, expanding the need for accessibility considerations in both scope and complexity.</li>
  <li>There is a wealth of information available about Web accessibility, including many different sets of guidelines.<spanstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This wide range of information can create its own challenges. Which guidelines should an organization use? On which expert should an organization rely? There is almost too much information and it can be difficult to make use of it. It sometimes forces organizations to leap from theory with industry guidelines directly into the practice of implementing those guidelines. There is a gap between theory and practice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Innovation Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>With technology and the Web there is a rapid development cycle and a push to be more and more innovative. When something new or interesting comes out, accessibility must be infused from the very beginning so that the result is accessible or there must be an accessible way of representing it.</p>
  <li>The number of government agencies providing eGovernment services is growing.Often these are Web&nbsp;2.0&#8209;type activities, such as collecting taxes, paying parking tickets, online education, etc. These Web&nbsp;2.0&#8209;type applications are highly interactive and highly complex. When you look at WCAG&nbsp;1.0, written in 1999, you cannot apply it to the kinds of services being delivered today.<spanstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>
  <li>When talking about innovation and accessibility there is the misperception that accessibility is playing to the lowest common denominator and about making things boring. The reality is that accessibility is a challenge that, when relished, is an opportunity to create innovative user interfaces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stakeholder Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Organizations can be complex. Owners of particular products, services or information often own everything about them, including the online presence. Engaging with these stakeholders is critical but difficult. </p>
              <li>Stakeholders often practice Grudging accessibility or just going through a checklist because someone has required it. This does not help usability and inclusivity.People need to be focusing on inclusiveness in order to reap the benefits.</p>
              <li>Often when stakeholders are told their Web sites or intranets are inaccessible the reaction is consistent; it is like the five stages of grieving, or rather the five stages of accessibility acceptance: </p>
              <li>Denial: It cannot be important. Where will we get the funding?</p>
              <li>Anger: often stakeholders are very angry to hear they are inadequate in this area. </p>
              <li>Bargaining: stakeholders work out how to get around accessibility and how to cope with it without really having to start again</p>
              <li>Depression: often happens when stakeholders start looking at WCAG 1.0.</p>
              <li>Finally, after stakeholders work out what needs to be done and have carried out some research, they reach acceptance. This can take years for some stakeholders.</p>
              <li>It can be difficult to develop a consistent or sustainable approach to Web accessibility across an organization, so when an employee/evangelist with expertise moves on to a new job or a new role, they take their experience and knowledge with them and it dissipates.</p>
              <li>Accessibility typically is not a budgeted line item for most organizations.It is, unfortunately, usually a competing interest. Given the way that technology works, it is one of many things that organizations have to weigh in terms of whether it will make the list of things that they are going to do.</p>
              <li>When stakeholders are building a new Web site or intranet and there are an extensive number of competing requirements for functions and features, accessible design may be on the list but may be one of many competing interests.When stakeholders do not understand accessibility, it is likely to fall to the bottom of such lists.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Practical Strategies for an Accessible Web</h2>
            <p>By design, the European Dialogues on Web Accessibility focused on exploring solutions and approaches to address challenges and promote a higher rate of Web accessibility. The experts on the Dialogue panels and in the audience identified a long list of practical strategies, including:</p>
            <h3>Use Standards Smartly</h3>
            <ul>
  <li>Technical specifications and guidelines are a cornerstone of an effective Web accessibility strategy. </p>
  <li>It is important to recognize the emergence of new technologies and to utilize up to date standards. For example WCAG 1.0 is not designed or applicable to building a Web application that is interactive and involves menus, dialogs, scripting, and back and forth conversation between the end user and the server.WCAG&nbsp;2.0 was designed to address some of these issues and to be applicable to new technologies as they emerge.</li>
  <li>However, even WCAG&nbsp;2.0 will never be the singular solution to making Web sites accessible. Web sites change continually so the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) can be an important standards tool.Even though WCAG defines what it means to be an accessible Web site, ATAG ensures that, over the long term, the production of Web content will be accessible.</li>
  <li>While standards can give a solid foundation for accessible Web sites, organizations should not expect to use them off the shelf.They will likely need to be interpreted for each organization.</li>
  <li>Make ownership of accessibility standards as broad as possible within an organization, so that they do not become just the opinion or preference of one person.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Raise Awareness and Knowledge</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>People do not set out to create inaccessible Web sites  so education is key. Give people the awareness, the desire and the technical skills to deliver accessible IT solutions. If they are not aware of it, if it is outside their frame of reference, if they do not have the skills to deliver it, they will not create accessible Web sites.</li>
  <li>Training software professionalsthe people who create development environments and authoring toolsshould be a top priority. Often, content creators are not the appropriate people to fix accessibility problems.</li>
  <li>Education and training is critical not only for developers, but also for designers, editors and even management. Knowledge directly affects Web site creation and impacts the creation of goals and strategies that support Web accessibility.</li>
  <li>Raising awareness among business unit owners and sponsors helps them to understand why accessibility is important, and then they may even start demanding it from their IT professionals, rather than having it forced upon them.High-level awareness presentations can talk about what accessibility is, why it is important, and what the benefits are.</li>
  <li>Cross-training and train the trainer approaches can be very effective in organizations of all sizes. Best practices can be extended throughout an organization by identifying individuals and teams that are getting it right and building accessible Web sites. Invite them to showcase their work and to share lessons learned about what works well.</li>
  <li>Training should focus on the rationale behind guidelines strategies for creating an accessible user experience. The point is not to tick every single compliance box just for the sake of it. Education and training should result in a Web site that is usable by everyone.</li>
  <li>The Web 2.0 world of user-generated content makes accessibility education and training even more important. Many organizations of all types are encouraging people to share their knowledge in blogs and wikis. Strategies to teach people to generate content in an accessible way include articles on an intranet, road shows, and training sessions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Institutionalize Accessibility</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Within an organization of any size, moving from a guerrilla campaign for an accessible Web to a more institutionalized approach can be difficult.</li>
  <li>Creating an Accessibility Center of Excellence or Web Standards Forum within an organization can help to define accessibility standards and practices and to drive broad implementation.</li>
  <li>A Web accessibility group should include representatives from across an organization, including influential decision-makers and senior people, so they can help achieve buy in and to raise the profile of accessibility.</li>
  <li>A Web accessibility group can bring draft strategies to decision-makers and seek the real authority to drive a strategic approach to accessibility.</li>
  <li>Horizontal networking  working together in an organization (and externally) with other webmasters and content owners that face similar challenges--can help solve everyday problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Test and Benchmark Appropriately</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Many organizations have hundreds of Web sites and millions of Web pages so automatic tools are needed to help identify potential issues.</li>
  <li>The key to automation is repeatability. A repeatable process is important for measuring progress over time.</li>
  <li>Often, a small number of Web sites generate the most traffic.Focusing accessibility testing and remediation on those key sites can enable more rapid progress in the area of accessible Web sites. Automatic scanning tools can allow for quickly selecting any kind of criteria to check against.</li>
  <li>Understanding and interpreting the results of automated tools is important. The reports can sometimes be misleading. For example, if a search box on every page of a Web site is missing a label or not properly tagged, then it could cause 100% failure across all pages. One quick fix could bring several pages into compliance.</li>
  <li>The challenge with any kind of benchmarking, auditing or testing is that Web content is dynamic by nature  it changes all the time. Even if a Web site is accessible one minute, it can change 100 times in the next hour as thousands of content creators add new content.</li>
  <li>However, testing for accessibility is not only an automatic process.It is important to recognize that there are three additional types of testing that are appropriate in different situations and for different purposes that can lead to even more useful information: functional testing, usability testing and compliance testing. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Note: The last chapter in this guide describes these three types of testing in more detail. It also discusses the importance of sequencing them in the right order to achieve the best results.</i></li>
  <li>Compliance testing focuses on adherence to technical specifications.It answers the question, Does a Web site comply with a standard?</li>
  <li>Functional testing is about whether the product works as it is designed, and whether the design is a reasonably functional design. Does it actually incorporate accessibility needs? Was it designed to work with a mouse, to read out loud in order, to use large fonts and so on?  Functional testing prioritizes by user scenario, addressing task completion and the importance of that particular task.</li>
  <li>Usability testing is about whether actual people can use the product.It involves people using a Web site with their relevant software and assistive technologies. This testing can provide broad and deep insights into additional issues that guidelines will never cover.</li>
  <li>User error is a factor with usability testing. A Web site might expose everything the way it is supposed to and meet relevant standards but users still may not be able to use it. That is a different question than whether it was designed well and does it meet a standard. Usability testing is best done last, after confirming that other key aspects work.</li>
  <li>Rigorously testing all templates used by Web teams and the gateway pages can help ensure that at least the main elements are accessible and can be used by people with assistive technologies to create Web pages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Make It Easy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If it is easy to do the right thing, people are much more likely to do it.If you create accessible content by default and someone has to do something to change it, they are less likely to do so.If you create content that is not accessible and if you have to then do something additional, it is that much more of a barrier to Web accessibility.</li>
  <li>Developers can design and develop software in such a way that end users do not have to think about making accessible web content; since it is built into the tools,  they get the accessible solution by default.</li>
  <li>A standard software engineering practice is to take functionality that is duplicated in multiple places and to bring it in to a single control.  Each of the different places can reference the single control, which avoids replicating the same work over and over again. Web accessibility examples include functions and libraries in coding environments or Comet controls in Windows. Web services such as third-party shopping carts are another example of something where specialized knowledge has been concentrated into a single place.</li>
  <li>Do not become a checkpoint service. Focus on real life issues. It is a myth that accessible Web sites do not look as nice or do not have as rich functionality as inaccessible Web sites. Web developers love the challenge of creating an accessible, engaging, attractive user experience, regardless of whether you can see the screen, understand the language, or use the mouse. It is all achievable; it just requires some innovative thinking. Stick to the guidelines as your bedrock and understand what they are trying to achieve.</li>
  <li>Many Web developers and content creators will never gain a complete knowledge of web accessibility. Automated tools can help fill in the knowledge gaps, but a comprehensive accessibility toolkit that includes manual inspection, tutorials, and other resources as in addition to automated checks will provide the range of support needed by developers.</li>
  <li>Do not expect industry guidelines, technical specifications, or checkpoints to be broadly usable off the shelf. They can be open to interpretation by many different Web developers and content creators. They can be an exceptional starting point to promote an understanding of accessibility and to provide a foundation for further work, but they are more useful when turned into a set of standards specific to an organization and its developers, suppliers, and customers.</li>
  <li>Combine additional best practices and pragmatism with industry guidelines and technical specifications. Once those standards are in place, adhere to them every time a Web site or intranet is developed.  Test against them.</li>
  <li>A set of internal standards can be the operational way for developers to implement an organizations strategy. It can control the way that developers code pages, so that anything that produced during the development stage should meet internal standards.</li>
  <li>A lower level, completely organization-specific set of very detailed internal standards can provide an almost paint by numbers product for developers.For every element on a page it tells them how it will behave, the size, the branding elements to use, the color, the behavior of the content when it is clicked, etc.It can leave absolutely no room for interpretation.It can guarantee accessibility compliance and brand compliance.</li>
  <li>Content creators may require additional tools.Increasingly they are not technology professionals and have little or no accessibility expertise.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Require Compliance and Governance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not rely on peoples best efforts or goodwill to use internal standards, tools, practices, and strategies for Web accessibility. Put a governance process in place. Require compliance and penalize non-compliance.</li>
              <li>Governance provides a set of rails for people to run along.It gives needed guidance to do their jobs properly but it also gives the mechanism to identify non-compliance and a means of dealing with it.</li>
              <li>A governance process does two things at the outset:  1. it makes sure that internal standards are adhered to during the design and development process of Web sites and intranets; 2. it means that procurement documentation includes the right questions to help people purchase accessible solutions.</li>
              <li>A governance process must also effectively address non&#8209;compliance  perhaps through a waiver process. If a project does not meet an internal accessibility standard it is best to understand the issues and create a managed remediation plan.</li>
              <li>A waiver for non-compliance may require an assessment of risk and a time bound action plan for making adjustments and improvements as well as steps to minimize the impact on staff and customers. It could be signed off by very senior people within the organization.</li>
              <li>An effective governance process should make it easier for people to comply with internal standards than get through the waiver process.</li>
              <li>A governance process does not have to be hundreds of pages long; it should be a clear, concise policy document.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Approach Web Accessibility as a Process</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A full lifecycle approach to Web accessibility can be effective. The lifecycle begins with an accessible design and continues after the launch of a Web site with good solutions to maintain the compliance of the site.</li>
              <li>Incorporate accessibility as part of the build process, so that designers and developers, and even the tools themselves, enable accessibility to the greatest extent possible.</li>
              <li>Timing can be vital. With any large Web project, there is a window of a few months in which people are planning what will happen over the longer term.Missing that window means probably means missing an accessibility feature in the next release. It is important to really understand an organization and the points at which decisions can be influenced.</li>
              <li>A lifecycle approach can include several stages.A first stage would be an assessment of existing Web sites and benchmarking them against standards and guidelines along with a review of the technologies the site should support such as Flash, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTML, etc. A second stage would be an examination of resources needed  both internal and external. A third stage would include defining a strategy, including a quality assurance and testing plan.Once all these plans are in place, a fourth stage would focus on design, prototyping and testing.A final stage would include feedback, refining code libraries, making sure style guides are up to date, and building in checks for accessibility at regular intervals.</li>
              <li>Within any process, focus on prioritization, both in testing and fixing problems, to ensure the most impact. When evaluating the functional aspects of accessibility and what may need to be fixed, consider the use of scenarios to determine which things are the most important for the user.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Evangelize and Engage</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Many Web accessibility projects fail because nobody has clear ownership of accessibility within the organization. There must be an accessibility project manager for the whole course of a project and beyond. Define who has ownership, who is driving it, and who is managing it.</li>
              <li>In addition to a project manager, choose an accessibility champion.It should be someone senior in the organization that takes responsibility for the accessibility strategy and, when it matters, is prepared to stand up and be counted. Decide how serious the organization is about accessibility. To what lengths is it prepared to go in order to enforce an accessibility standard?</li>
              <li>Determine the key stakeholders within an organization. Who has an interest in making a Web site accessible? This could include Web teams, procurement teams, legal teams, and marketing and branding teams, who quite often are forgotten until towards the end and may come up with a number of missing things.</li>
              <li>Define the key stakeholders and interview them. In large organizations there can be a lot of politics and emotion involved in how people want the Web site to be, so get it all out on the table. Figure it out. What are peoples hopes and goals? What do they want to achieve? What are their fears?</li>
              <li>Engage individually with a variety of people and sell them the message in the way that is important to them. Different messages resonate with different people. The most successful seem to be a combination of this is an interesting problem that you can solve which helps people and also makes money.</li>
              <li>If it is a business person, then maybe the business opportunities of a growing aging demographic will resonate.</li>
              <li>If it is a user interface designer, then focusing on interesting user interface challenges may make accessibility a more appealing topic.</li>
              <li>If it is a developer, then discussions might focus on code quality, standards and implementation.</li>
              <li>If it is a tester, then how accessibility impacts quality might be of interest.</li>
              <li>Senior level executive buy in to accessibility is absolutely essential.People at the grassroots level, the developers and the designers, are critical to delivering accessibility from the bottom up. However, executive buy in to mandate it from the top down is equally important.Much of the actual guidance and leadership comes from the middle.</li>
